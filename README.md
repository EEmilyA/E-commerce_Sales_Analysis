   ###Dashboard

### Key Findings and Insights
2.1 Retention Rate Analysis
The retention rate provides a clear indication of customer loyalty and the ability to retain customers over time.
#### Retention Rate:
The calculated retention rate is 90.15%, indicating that a significant customer base is satisfied with the service rendered. Only 9.85% of customers are classified as non-returning.	This suggests a strong retention rate, implying that customers find value in the store and are likely repeat buyers.
### Delivery and Sales
The analysis of Delivery Status versus Sales provides insight into how the shipping method impacts total sales and the customer experience.
### Total Sales by Shipping Type:
- Standard shipping generated the largest share of sales at $14,768,440, followed by Expedited and Overnight options.
Same Day delivery, though popular, contributed less to overall sales at $1,249,845.
#### Delivery Status Impact:
1 Late deliveries represent the largest portion of sales at 52.13%, followed by Advanced shipping (24.20%) and Canceled orders (4.40%).
This indicates that despite late deliveries, a large proportion of revenue comes from customers who may still be willing to purchase, though it might affect customer satisfaction in the long term

### Shipping Type vs Delivery Performance
The analysis of shipping types versus delivery status helps us understand the impact of different shipping options on delivery performance.
- Advanced Shipping had the highest percentage of successful delivery performance, especially for Standard shipping.
- Late deliveries were higher for Standard shipping, which could indicate operational or logistical challenges affecting on-time delivery.
- Shipped on time made up only 4.04% of the sales for expedited shipping, suggesting that expedited orders might not always arrive as expected.
  
### Seasonal Sales Trend
The seasonal trend analysis shows how sales fluctuate over the years.
1  Sales have grown significantly since 2015: 
2015 saw sales of $405,719, 2021 and 2022 had substantial growth, with sales reaching $11,631,365 and $11,534,723, respectively.
- This indicates a significant upward trend in sales over the years, especially in recent years (2021-2022), likely due to increased demand, effective marketing strategies, or external factors like the pandemic.
- 
### Regional Performance Analysis
The performance by region shows how sales are distributed across different geographical areas:
- Top Performing Region: The East region generated the highest sales of $7,189,639, followed by the West region with $8,079,236.
- The Central and South regions have slightly lower sales, but still make significant contributions.
- 
### Yearly Sales by Category and Product Segment
The breakdown of sales by Product Category shows which categories are performing the best over the years.
- Consumer Products have consistently shown strong sales, reaching $5,978,775 in 2022.
- Corporate products showed steady growth, and Home Office sales were also strong, particularly in 2021 and 2022.
### Top 10 Products
The Top 10 selling products highlight the most popular items in the dataset.
- Staples and Staple Envelopes are the highest selling products, with sales of $125,037 and $124,814, respectively.
- Other popular products include Avery Non-Stick Binders, KI Adjustable-Height Table, and Staple Remover.
- 
## Conclusions and Recommendations
### Customer Retention and Loyalty
- 	Retention Rate is high at 90.15%, which suggests strong customer loyalty. However, the 9.85% of customers who are not returning should be investigated further to understand barriers to re-purchase, such as product offerings, pricing, or delivery issues.
###  Delivery and Shipping
- The impact of Late deliveries on sales shows that even delayed orders still generate revenue. It is recommended to improve delivery reliability, especially for Standard shipping, to maintain or improve customer satisfaction.
### Operational Improvements
- 	Addressing the causes of late deliveries could significantly improve the customer experience, potentially boosting customer retention and overall sales.
- Offering expedited shipping options could help cater to more urgent customer needs but may need to be aligned with better performance in meeting delivery timelines.
  
  ###  Product and Category Analysis
- Focusing on Consumer products and Staples as the top-selling items could provide more opportunities for marketing and promotional efforts.
- Expanding the Home Office category further, which has shown consistent growth, may help capture more sales, especially given the rising trend of remote work.
  
  ### Geographical Insights
- 	The East and West regions have shown strong performance. However, the South and Central regions should be looked into for potential growth opportunities. Targeted marketing or promotional campaigns could boost sales in these areas.

### Final Recommendations
1.	Customer Retention: Focus on understanding why 9.85% of customers are not returning and create strategies (e.g., loyalty programs, better delivery options) to address this.
2.	Improve Delivery Reliability: Given that late deliveries impact a large percentage of sales, improving delivery times could enhance customer experience and retention.
3.	Leverage High-Performing Products: Continue promoting high-demand items like Staples, and invest in growing Home Office products, which have shown positive growth.
4.	Geographic Focus: To maximize sales, conduct targeted campaigns in underperforming regions like the South and Central regions
